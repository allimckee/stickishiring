STICK IS BUILDING FOUNDING TEAM
Seeking Inventors and Builders to bring Automated Illustration Software to Life

Hi, I’m Alli. I’ve started a company called Stick, and I’m looking for a technical co-founder and a founding Engineer. In case it might be you or someone you know, let me tell you more.
 
-----------------------------------WHY THIS?-----------------------------------

WHY DOES STICK EXIST?
 
You’re overwhelmed by your inbox. You’re bored by bad PowerPoints. We get it. You need more effective and efficient ways to engage at work. Instagram and Snapchat have shown us that the world is shifting to become more and more visual, but work communication tools are lagging.  We live in images, but we work in words. Stick can change that. We're democratizing design so that our visual generation can communicate and connect the way we're meant to - with images.
 
WHAT IS STICK's PRODUCT?
 
We’re building a tool to automate the illustration of ideas. While we’re starting with a Chrome plug-in for visual email, the vision is to become the go-to platform for people to create visuals of all kinds. We aren’t trying to build something that Microsoft will buy in two years. We want to become a Microsoft in ten.
 
-----------------------------------WHY US?-----------------------------------

WHO IS ON STICK's TEAM?
 
Right now, “we” is just me - Alli McKee. I’m a “Visionary” looking for an “Inventor” and a “Builder” to join me in bringing this vision to life. But I’m not the Erlich-Bachman-Vision-Questing type of Visionary – I’m a hustler, constant learner, and a striver.
 
WHAT HAS THIS "VISIONARY" ACTUALLY DONE?

Since founding Blot, inc. (the legal company behind Stick) in March 2015, I have:

·   Learned how to turn text to visuals. I’ve spent 1500+ hours illustrating ideas in the past two years (not including 15+ yrs as an artist/designer). I’ve generated 2880+ pages of illustrated business content through Stanford GSB coursework and visual captures for events like Innovation Endeavor’s Curiosity Camp. At this point, I’ve got the text-to-visual system down.
 
·   Built a mobile app. Created UX + UI design for iPad and iPhone visual note-taking app. Managed contracted engineer overseas throughout multiple iterations of the mobile development process. The app was a total flop, but I learned why, pivoted, and moved forward.
 
·   Run visual trainings globally. Delivered training sessions and consulting on how to incorporate visuals into everyday work to 181+ paying participants across industries and seven countries, from Cuba to the UAE to Brazil. 
 
·   Interviewed users, constantly. I’ve interviewed 608 users (and counting) and have shared the idea with over 2500 people across various iterations of this company. The product has evolved, but the “why” has not. I’ve learned that people don’t just want a better way. They need it.
 
·   Surrounded myself with people smarter than I am. Instead of having one co-founder, I’ve had about a dozen rotating “co-founders,” as I’ve been seeking advice and collaborating with some of the best product managers, designers, and business leaders in the industry, from companies like Prezi, IDEO, and Tableau.
 
-----------------------------------WHY YOU?----------------------------------- 
 
Who is Stick looking for?
 
The Inventor - CTO: You’re an architect who loves big ideas and figuring out ways to solve tough problems. You want to redesign the way an entire generation communicates. You’re never satisfied and have a relentless drive to make a difference in the world to make as broad an impact as possible. When you hear “that’s not possible” you don’t give up… instead, you realize you might be onto something. You’re the Visionary’s thought partner, and the Builder’s guide. The question that keeps you up at night is, How do we best build a tool that “just fits” into our user’s life to make it better?
 
The Builder - Founding Engineer: You’re a hustler who pushes for efficiency with a strong 80/20 mindset. You love to make things work. You can break down a big idea into smaller steps, and then eliminate half of them. You’ve got a nose for what’s most important, and you focus on building and testing, as quickly as possible. You work closely with the Inventor to shape the landscape of the product you’re building, and work with the Visionary to understand the users - again, and again. The question that keeps you up at night is, What’s the scrappiest way to make this work and how do we get it in front of a user even faster?
 
What specific technologies are you using?
 
I’ve got a general idea, but ultimately that’s your job, not mine. The working plan is to hack together Javascript + APIs + a broad-match database to build a Chrome extension that plugs into your email client to help you visualize your email. That said, I’m only “semi-technical” after Hackbright, so I’m open to your ideas. (I was going to write this job description in Python to show off my new skills but didn’t want to pull a Haagen Daz).
 
When are you hiring? What’s your timeline?
 
Now. We want to bring on an Inventor as a part-time/consulting CTO until we raise money, at which point the role would transition to full-time. We’re looking to bring on a Builder full-time to start turning the “manual MVP” into code right away, with the guidance of the consulting CTO.
 
Where are you located?
 
San Francisco. Currently at 600 California St, but flexible. While I don’t believe in putting in face time, I believe in seeing your face. (“Working from home” means checking your email in sweatpants with Silicon Valley on in the background, and that’s just not a thing - for us, at least).
 
How much will I get paid? How are you funded?
 
Not much… yet. We’re bootstrapped, so resources are tight until we can get a product out there with enough traction to raise money. While we aren’t there yet, I’m about to sell my car so you can eat and pay rent. We will make it work.
 
Once we’re ready, I’ve got a strong network of advisors and investors so I’m confident we can raise money to offer you a solid compensation package. I’m also eager to share ownership of the company with people who care as much about solving this problem as I do, so there are opportunities for generous equity compensation, as well.
 
The bottom line: This is a super high risk, super high return opportunity. To be honest, though - if you’re in this for the money, you probably aren’t the right fit.

-----------------------------------BUT REALLY, WHY JOIN US?-----------------------------------
 
I’m don’t like self-promotion, but I asked former colleagues to tell you why you would want to work with me on Stick. Here’s what they said:
 
“Collaborative, passionate and have a nose for what moves the needle. Plus such high energy the day flies by” 
– Colleague, Bain & Company
 
“Best balance of a visionary plus an executor. You’ve got a growth mindset – ready to learn new things always (coding most recently). And on top of it all you’ve got the compassion to make sure everyone is learning and enjoying the ride along the way.” 
– Classmate, Stanford
 
“1. Strong ability to understand, explore and tackle business challenges, thanks to Bain/GSB. 2. Far beyond what most of those clowns have, you also possess an incredible creative energy/ability that provides innovative solutions and delivers value beautifully. 3. You make for a powerful co-creator who shares the stage but never shirks from your load 4. You also bring a light and energy that makes everyday a pleasure; you’re resilient and you don’t let a down day derail you. 5. You WILL be successful in this venture or the next, so this person is better of knowing you before you’re too big of a deal.” 
– Colleague, ALA
 
“You’re really passionate about your idea. You have a long-term vision that you’ve been working on for years. Everyone who’s seen what you do agrees that this needs to be a product.” 
– Classmate, Stanford
 
I hope you’ll consider joining me.
